<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Calvin 🙌, a high school senior from Ghana, passionate about the fascinating world of computer science 🖥️. My journey in tech began at The Presbyterian Boys’ Secondary School, Legon, where my curiosity and drive led me to delve deep into programming and web development. This fall, I am excited to start a new chapter at Kenyon College 🎓, aiming to major in neuroscience with a minor in computer science.

</p>

<p>I thrive on the challenge of building and shipping products rapidly ⏩, a skill I honed through various coding projects and competitions. My projects range from creating engaging websites to developing a Buzzfeed-style personality quiz and an activist toolkit site 🌍. These experiences have not only refined my technical skills but have also taught me the importance of user-centric design and agile product development.

<p>Outside the world of code, I have a profound love for tennis 🎾, music 🎶, and community service ❤️. I've combined these interests in unique ways, such as co-founding 'Sounds of Hope', where we performed in hospitals across Central Accra to raise awareness and funds for pediatric cancer and Alzheimer’s disease 🏥. Whether it's through my saxophone melodies with the Odade3 Jazz Ensemble or coding new software, I am driven by a desire to make a positive impact in my community and beyond.
